# Information

This is a release to sort out some performance issues for first round of performance testing.  The App is changed to get the 8km TA to station relationship from a cached dataset, as opposed to inline which is causing a service/database bottleneck

# Instructions

Note: The cached data set is going to be updated/delivered into the service in the same job that updates the target area dataset, as this is the time that the dataset will need to be refreshed fully.
