The gauge at Lodore is forecast to continue to drop steadily through today, Friday 23/8/19, but is likely to remain above the 1.4m flood alert level, meaning that low lying land around the lake, and possibly near to the river, may remain flooded. A Flood Warning remains in force for Keswick Campsite. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will update this message if the situation changes"
