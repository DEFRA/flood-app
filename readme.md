### Developing the application

When making changes to the application, bear in mind that certain aspects and components are only updated when you perform the **npm run build** stage.

If your changes are not reflected in the browser/console, you should check this first.

# Environment variables

Create a .env file at the root of the project to set your environment variables locally, which is especially useful during development. The [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package facilitates this by automatically loading these variables at application start. This approach is recommended as a simpler alternative to global settings, like those in .bashrc. 

For DEFRA employees, examples of these environment variables are available in our private lfwconfig repository.
