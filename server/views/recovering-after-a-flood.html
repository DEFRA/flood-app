        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How to recover after a flood</h1>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Contact your insurance company</h3>
        <p>If you’ve been flooded, contact your insurance company and follow their advice. If you haven’t got insurance, the <a href="http://www.nationalfloodforum.org.uk">National Flood Forum</a> can offer help and support on 01299 403055.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Find your local flood action group or flood warden</h3>
        <p>If there’s been a serious flood, your local authority may have chosen a place like the town hall as a ‘flood hub’ from which to organise recovery efforts. You may also have a nearby flood warden or flood action group. Contact the <a data-journey-click="PRR:recovering-after-a-flood_Find your local flood action group or flood warden:National Flood Forum" href="http://www.nationalfloodforum.org.uk">National Flood Forum</a> for help in finding local support.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Check if you can return home</h3>
        <p>If you’ve had to leave your home, check with the emergency services that it’s safe before you return.</p>
        <p>Your home or business may also need a safety inspection by the utility companies before you can turn the water, gas and electricity back on.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cleaning and repairing your home</h3>
        <p>Take advice from specialists before starting repairs to your property. Most of the repair work after flooding will need to be undertaken by professionals appointed by your insurers.</p>
        <p>Flood water may contain harmful substances like sewage, chemicals and animal waste which could make you unwell. If you come into contact with flood water, wash your hands thoroughly.</p>
        <p>When cleaning your home after a flood always wear gloves, a face mask and sturdy footwear. Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/348920/Flooding_how_to_clean_up_your_house_safely.pdf">how to clean up your home safely</a> after a flood.</p>
        <p>Before you start cleaning, take photographs to document damage and record the flood water height. Ask your insurer before discarding items that cannot be cleaned, like mattresses and carpets.</p>
        <p>If you use heaters or dehumidifiers to dry out your property, make sure there’s good ventilation. Never use petrol or diesel-powered generators indoors – their exhaust gases are potentially lethal.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about recovering from a flood, such as disposing of used sandbags or damaged furniture, contact <a data-journey-click="PRR:recovering-after-a-flood_Cleaning and repairing your home:your local authority" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">your local authority</a>. They should help with collecting large flood-damaged items. They’ll tell you where to put them and when they may be collected.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Protect your property from future floods</h3>
        <p>To reduce flood damage you could take measure such as laying tiles instead of carpets, moving electrical sockets higher up the walls and fitting non-return valves.</p>
        <p>Suppliers of flood products and services can be found on the <a href="http://bluepages.org.uk">Bluepages</a>.</p>

        <p>You can get support from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">your local health protection team</a> to prevent and reduce the effect of diseases.</p>
        <p>Don’t eat food that’s touched flood water. If your electricity is off, don’t eat fresh food from a fridge after 4 hours or from a freezer after 24 hours.</p>
