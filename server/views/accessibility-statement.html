    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
    <p>The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>
    <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <p>On the 'Check for flooding in England' page, the button is missing a role attribute, so people using voice activation cannot access the button as the screen reader sees it as a link. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).
    <br/>We plan to add 'button' to the role attribute by December 2021.</p>
    <p>On the 'River, sea, groundwater and rainfall levels' page, both the 'Clear all filters' and 'View map' links have the attribute role=" button". People using voice activation cannot access these links as the screen reader sees them as buttons. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).<br/>
    We plan to make these look like buttons by December 2021.</p>
    <p>On the 'River, sea, groundwater and rainfall levels' page, the 'Clear all filters' link cannot be navigated to using the keyboard. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (keyboard accessible).<br/>
    We plan to enable tabindex by December 2021.</p>
    <p>On the 'River, sea, groundwater and rainfall levels' page, it's unclear what the icons mean. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).<br/>
    We plan to add alternate text or an accessible tooltip by December 2021.</p>
    <p>The copyright symbol on the maps cannot be selected by people using voice activation. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.5.3 (label in name).<br/>
    We plan to add copyright to the label by December 2021.</p>
    <p>When switching to Windows' high contrast mode, some of the button images disappear on maps. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).<br/>
    We plan to put the images in the markup by December 2021.</p>
    <p>On the 'River, sea, groundwater and rainfall levels' page,  the 'Clear all filters' button doesn't clear the checkboxes, but populates them. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (headings and labels).<br/>
    We plan to change the button text to 'Reset all filters' by December 2021.</p>
    <p>The colour combinations for some of the icons on the 'River, sea, groundwater and rainfall levels' page are of low contrast. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (non-text contrast).<br/>
    We plan to change the colour contrast ratios of the icons by December 2021.</p>
    <p>Some river level pages include a forecast of the level, and the forecast data is in the downloadable 'height data CSV'. But once downloaded, the forecast data is soon out of date as the forecast is updated every 15 minutes. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).<br/>
    We plan to have an alternative way to present the river level forecast in an accessible format by March 2022.</p>
    <p>Charts visually convey if a river level is rising, falling or stable. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).<br/>
    We plan to have a text version of this real time data by March 2022.</p>
    <p>Both an inactive threshold line and the 'close' button on a chart's label can’t be navigated to using the keyboard. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (keyboard accessible).<br/>
    We plan to address this by March 2022.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <p>The website has the following content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>online maps and mapping services</li>
      <li>third party content which is out of our control, for example a corporate logo on the map the website uses</li>
    </ul>
