          If groundwater height is below the level of a building, the risk of flooding from groundwater alone is unlikely.
          You can find out the height of any location using an ordnance survey map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flooding is more likely to occur when several things happen together, such as poor weather, high tides and high river and groundwater levels.

          We use measuring stations like this one to collect water level data, usually once or twice a day. We collect data more frequently
          when there's a greater risk of flooding. That's why the graph might show a short time lag since the last
