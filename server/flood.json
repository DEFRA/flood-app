Is this content about making a flood plan useful?Yes   No \r\nKnow how to turn off your gas, electricity and water\r\nIf you leave your home during a flood you’ll need to turn off your mains water, gas and electricity if it’s safe to do so. You should find out in advance how to do this.\r\n\r\nThe location of water stopcocks, gas shut-off valves and electrical master switches varies between properties. The gas shut-off valve is usually beside the meter. The mains electricity cut-off is usually a big red switch on your fuse box. If you can’t find your water stopcock, ask someone with practical experience or a plumber to help you.\r\n\r\nIs this content useful? Is this content about turning off your gas, electricity and water useful?Yes   No \r\nProtect your property\r\nYou can make changes to your property that will help you to get back to normal more quickly after a flood and reduce the damage flooding can do.\r\n\r\nTo reduce flood damage you can take steps such as laying tiles instead of carpets, moving electrical sockets higher up the wall and fitting non-return valves to stop flood water entering your property through the drains. Bluepages lists suppliers of flood products and services.\r\n\r\nFor more information on advance measures, get the National Flood Forum’s property protection guides for property owners or for local authorities and professionals.\r\n\r\nSimple maintenance like keeping drains and gullies clear of debris will also help to protect your property.\r\n\r\nIs this content useful?
