You should find out in advance how to do this.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe location of water stopcocks, gas shut-off valves and electrical master switches varies between properties. The gas shut-off valve is usually beside the meter. The mains electricity cut-off is usually a big red switch on your fuse box. If you can’t find your water stopcock, ask someone with practical experience or a plumber to help you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Protect your property</h3>\r\n<p>You can make changes to your property that will help you to get back to normal more quickly after a flood and reduce the damage flooding can do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo reduce flood damage you can take steps such as laying tiles instead of carpets, moving electrical sockets higher up the wall and fitting non-return valves to stop flood water entering your property through the drains. Bluepages lists suppliers of flood products and services.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor more information on advance measures, get the National Flood Forum’s property protection guides for property owners or for local authorities and professionals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSimple maintenance like keeping drains and gullies clear of debris will also help to protect your property.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Check your insurance</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nMake sure you have insurance to protect your home or business.
