The detailed forecast for those that use it is for a peak level at Great Yarmouth of 1.26mAOD, on Wednesday 31st October, which is 0.38m above tide tables, wind Force 6, west south-westerly. (mAODN is height above average sea level, for more info refer to local tide tables). We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages for this area at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and will update this message as necessary.",
